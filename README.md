## Installation
In your terminal:
```bash
npm i -g cross-post-blog
```

*For macOS M1 see: [Installing on macOS](MACOS_M1.md)*

## Usage

### Configure
For obtaining tokens from providers: [Obtaining key for dev.to | medium | hashnode](CONFIGURE.md)
* Configure your specific key from your platform
```bash 
# [platform]: dev | hashnode | medium

cross-post config [platform]
```

### Cross Posting Your Articles

To cross post your articles, you will use the following command:

```bash
cross-post run <url> [options]
```

Where `url` is the URL of your article that you want to cross post. `options` can be:

1. `-p, --platforms [platforms...]` The platform(s) you want to post the article on. By default if this option is not included, it will be posted on all the platforms. An example of its usage:

    ```bash
    cross-post run <url> -p dev hashnode
    ```

2. `-t, --title [title]` The title by default will be taken from the URL you supplied, however, if you want to use a different title you can supply it in this option.
3. `-s, --selector [selector]` by default, the `selector` config value or the `article` selector will be used to find your article in the URL you pass as an argument. However, if you need a different selector to be used to find the article, you can pass it here.
4. `-pu, --public` by default, the article will be posted as a draft (or hidden for hashnode due to the limitations of the Hashnode API). You can pass this option to post it publicly.
5. `-i, --ignore-image` this will ignore uploading an image with the article. This helps avoid errors when an image cannot be fetched.
6. `-is, --image-selector [imageSelector]` this will select the image from the page based on the selector you provide, instead of the first image inside the article. This option overrides the default image selector in the configurations.
7. `-iu, --image-url [imageUrl]` this will use the image URL you provide as a value of the option and will not look for any image inside the article.
8. `-ts, --title-selector [titleSelector]` this will select the title from the page based on the selector you provide, instead of the first heading inside the article. This option overrides the default title selector in the configurations.

This command will find the HTML element in the URL page you pass as an argument and if found, it will extract the title (if no title is passed in the arguments) and cover image.

#### Cross Posting Local Markdown Files

Starting from version 1.2.3, you can now post local markdown files to the platforms. Instead of passing a URL, pass the path to the file with the option `-l` or `--local`.

For example:

```bash
# canonicalUrl is optional 
cross-post run /path/to/test.md -l <canonicalUrl> 
```

You can also use any of the previous options mentioned.

#### Selector Configuration

If you need this tool to always use the same selector for the article, you can set the default selector in the configuration using the following command:

```bash
cross-post config selector
```

Then, you'll be prompted to enter the selector you want. After you set the default selector, all subsequent `run` commands will use the same selector unless you override it using the option `--selector`.

#### Image Selector Configuration

If you need this tool to always use the same selector for the image, you can set the default image selector in the configuration using the following command:

```bash
cross-post config imageSelector
```

Then, you'll be prompted to enter the image selector you want. After you set the default image selector, all subsequent `run` commands will use the same selector unless you override it using the option `--image-selector`.

#### Title Selector Configuration

If you need this tool to always use the same selector for the title, you can set the default title selector in the configuration using the following command:

```bash
cross-post config titleSelector
```

Then, you'll be prompted to enter the title selector you want. After you set the default title selector, all subsequent `run` commands will use the same selector unless you override it using the option `--title-selector`.

#### Uploading Data URI Article Images

If your website's main article image is a [Data URL image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs), uploading it as it is would lead to an error on most platforms. There are 3 ways to avoid that:

##### Using a Cloudinary account

In this method, you'll need to create or use an already created Cloudinary account and the tool will use the account to upload the image and get a URL.

Follow the steps below:

1. Create a [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account.
2. Get the `cloud_name`, `api_key`, and `api_secret` from your account.
3. Run `cross-post config cloudinary` and enter the information as prompted. **Remember that all keys are stored on your local machine**.

That's it. Next time you run the `cross-post run` command, if the image is a Data URL image, it will be uploaded to Cloudinary to get a URL for it. You can delete the image once the article has been published publicly on the platforms.

##### Pass Image URL

You can pass an image URL as an option to `cross-post run` using `--image-url`.

##### Post Article Without Image

You can pass the option `--ignore-image` to `cross-post run` and the article will be published without an image.

#### Reset Configuration Values

you can reset configuration values for each platform like this

```bash
cross-post config reset <platform name>
```

for example,

```bash
cross-post config reset dev
```

will reset all configuration values for dev.to platform

All available reset commands are

```markdown
Commands:
  dev             reset configuration for dev.to
  medium          reset configuration for medium.com
  hashnode        reset configuration for hashnode.com
  cloudinary      reset configuration for cloudinary
  all             reset all *non-platform* configuration
```

The command `cross-post config reset all` or simply, `cross-post config reset` will reset every configuration value except the platform configuration values.
